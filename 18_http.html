<!-- CONTENT NEGOTIATION

     One of the things HTTP can do is called content negotiation. The Accept request
     header is used to tell the server what type of document the client would like to
     get. Many servers ignore this header, but when a server knows of various ways to
     encode a resource, it can look at this header and send the one that the client
     prefers.

     The URL https://eloquentjavascript.net/author is configured to respond with
     either plaintext, HTML, or JSON, depending on what the client asks for. These
     formats are identified by the standardized media types text/plain, text/html,
     and application/json.

     Send requests to fetch all three formats of this resource. Use the headers
     property in the options object passed to fetch to set the header named Accept to
     the desired media type.

     Finally, try asking for the media type application/rainbows+unicorns and see
     which status code that produces. -->

fetch('https://eloquentjavascript.net/author', {headers: {Accept: 'text/plain'}})
  .then(resp => resp.text())
  .then(text => console.log(text));

fetch('https://eloquentjavascript.net/author', {headers: {Accept: 'text/html'}})
  .then(resp => resp.text())
  .then(text => console.log(text));

fetch('https://eloquentjavascript.net/author', {headers: {Accept: 'application/json'}})
  .then(resp => resp.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json));

fetch('https://eloquentjavascript.net/author', {headers: {Accept: 'rainbows+unicorns'}})
  .then(resp => resp.text())
  .then(text => console.log(text));

// in a different way:
let url = 'https://eloquentjavascript.net/author';
let mediaTypes = ['text/plain', 'text/html', 
                  'application/json', 'rainbows+unicorns'];

async function makeReqs() {
    for (let type of mediaTypes) {
        let resp = await fetch(url, {headers: {Accept: type}});
        let body = await resp.text();
        console.log(`With ${type}: ${body}`);
    }
}

makeReqs();


<!-- A JavaScript workbench

     Build an interface that allows people to type and run pieces of JavaScript code.

     Put a button next to a <textarea> field that, when pressed, uses the Function
     constructor we saw in Chapter 10 to wrap the text in a function and call
     it. Convert the return value of the function, or any error it raises, to a
     string and display it below the text field. -->

<textarea id="code">return "hi";</textarea>
<button id="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output"></pre>

<script>
  // Your code here.
  let button = document.querySelector('#button');
  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    let code = document.querySelector('#code').value;
    try {
       let output = String(Function('', code)());
       document.querySelector('#output').textContent = output;
    } catch (e) {
       console.log(e);
    }
  });

<!-- Conway’s Game of Life -->

<!-- Conway’s Game of Life is a simple simulation that creates artificial “life”
on a grid, each cell of which is either alive or not. Each generation (turn),
the following rules are applied: -->

<!-- Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors
dies. -->

<!-- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
generation. -->

<!-- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell. -->

<!-- A neighbor is defined as any adjacent cell, including diagonally adjacent
ones. -->

<!-- Note that these rules are applied to the whole grid at once, not one square
at a time. That means the counting of neighbors is based on the situation at the
start of the generation, and changes happening to neighbor cells during this
generation should not influence the new state of a given cell. -->

<!-- Implement this game using whichever data structure you find
appropriate. Use Math.random to populate the grid with a random pattern
initially. Display it as a grid of checkbox fields, with a button next to it to
advance to the next generation. When the user checks or unchecks the checkboxes,
their changes should be included when computing the next generation. -->

<div id="grid"></div>
<button id="next">Next generation</button>

<script>
  // Your code here.
  let grid = document.querySelector('#grid');
  // create 40 x 40 grid of checkboxes
  for (let i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
    let div = document.createElement('div');
    for (let i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
      let checkbox = document.createElement('input');
      checkbox.type = 'checkbox';
      div.appendChild(checkbox);
    }
    grid.appendChild(div);
  }
</script>
